It begins with a short scene of a blue cartoon bird chirping on a branch in a bright green forest. The scene shifts to a sleeping rabbit in a burrow under a large tree. The rabbit wakes up, stretches, and walks outside. He inhales deeply, smells the flowers, and lies down in the grass. \n","\n","A red squirrel runs up to him and startles him awake. The rabbit notices an acorn that was dropped by the squirrel. He sees a tree full of acorns and attempts to shake the tree, but the tree won't budge. Then, he notices a butterfly and starts trying to catch it. The rabbit is ridiculed by the squirrel and his friends - a chipmunk and a chinchilla - because he can't catch the butterfly. Angry, the rabbit throws the acorn, which hits a bird on a tree branch.  \n","\n","Determined to get the butterfly, he breaks off a branch and uses it to carve arrows. The animals watch in shock and amusement. The rabbit ties a vine to the arrow and shoots it toward the butterfly. It misses, but scares the animals. He shoots another arrow that hits a vine wrapped around a rock, causing it to fall on the chinchilla. He traps the butterfly using another vine, but the squirrel distracts him and he lets it go.  \n","\n","Finally, the rabbit catches the butterfly.  Happy with his prize, he shows it off to the squirrel, who looks confused. Then the chipmunk throws acorns at the rabbit's head, which makes the butterfly fly away. He picks up another branch and tries to hit the squirrel, but instead hits a log, which rolls over and pins the chipmunk. The animals run away and the rabbit follows them.  \n","\n","He sneaks up on them, trying to hit the squirrel with the branch. They hear him and run. The rabbit follows them and stops to catch his breath. Then he sees an acorn roll in front of him.  Thinking it is the squirrel playing a trick on him, he starts looking for them.  The squirrel and chipmunk are watching, and the chipmunk urges the squirrel to hit the rabbit with an acorn.  \n","\n","When the squirrel takes aim, he is startled by the rabbit. He looks closer at the acorn, realizing it is a conker, not an acorn. He smiles wickedly and pulls out another one. The rabbit watches anxiously.  \n","\n","The squirrel takes aim and throws the conker at the rabbit's face, causing his eyes to go black and him to fall backward. The squirrel laughs as the video ends.  \n","\n","The credits roll, showing all the people involved in the creation of the film, followed by a short scene of a bird landing on the squirrel's back as he glides in the air.\n"]}],"source":["# Create the prompt.\n","prompt = \"Describe this video.\"\n","\n","# Set the model to Gemini 1.5 Pro.\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n","\n","# Make the LLM request.\n","print(\"Making LLM inference request...\")\n","response = model.generate_content([prompt, video_file],\n","                                  request_options={\"timeout\": 600})\n","print(response.text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IrPDYdQSKTg4"},"source":["## Delete File\n","\n","Files are automatically deleted after 2 days or you can manually delete them using `files.delete()`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"ggoi6wibct18","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716726887984,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2170,"user":{"displayName":"RAHUL KUMAR","userId":"04858592732229532104"}},"outputId":"1d0ea0e3-fe5a-4592-afe0-4d04c286e5a9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Deleted file https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/hngwmxuwd24n\n"]}],"source":["genai.delete_file(video_file.name)\n","print(f'Deleted file {video_file.uri}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K5oUCqb6IUnH"},"source":["## Learning more\n","\n","The File API lets you upload a variety of multimodal MIME types, including images, audio, and video formats.
